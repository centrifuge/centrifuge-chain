//! # Pallet-Restricted-Xtokens Module
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This pallet is a wrapper pallet over `orml-xtokens` and allows the runtime
//! to create arbitrary filters for transfers of x-chain-transfers.
//! The interface mimic 1-to-1 the interface of `orml-xtokens`.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable functions
//!
//! - `transfer`: Transfer local assets with given `CurrencyId` and `Amount`.
//! - `transfer_multiasset`: Transfer `MultiAsset` assets.
//! - `transfer_with_fee`: Transfer native currencies specifying the fee and
//!   amount as separate.
//! - `transfer_multiasset_with_fee`: Transfer `MultiAsset` specifying the fee
//!   and amount as separate.
//! - `transfer_multicurrencies`: Transfer several currencies specifying the
//!   item to be used as fee.
//! - `transfer_multiassets`: Transfer several `MultiAsset` specifying the item
//!   to be used as fee.
