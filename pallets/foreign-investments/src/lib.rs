//! # Foreign Investment pallet
//!
//! Enables investing, redeeming and collecting in foreign and non-foreign
//! currencies. Can be regarded as an extension of `pallet-investment` which
//! provides the same toolset for pool (non-foreign) currencies.
//!
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! ## Assumptions
//!
//! - The implementer of the pallet's associated `Investment` type sends
//!   notifications for collected investments via `CollectedInvestmentHook` and
//!   for collected redemptions via `CollectedRedemptionHook`]. Otherwise the
//!   payment and collected amounts for foreign investments/redemptions are
//!   never incremented.
//! - The implementer of the pallet's associated `TokenSwaps` type sends
//!   notifications for fulfilled swap orders via the `FulfilledSwapOrderHook`.
//!   Otherwise investment/redemption states can never advance the
//!   `ActiveSwapInto*Currency` state.
//! - The implementer of the pallet's associated `TokenSwaps` type sends
//!   notifications for fulfilled swap orders via the `FulfilledSwapOrderHook`.
//!   Otherwise investment/redemption states can never advance the
//!   `ActiveSwapInto*Currency` state.
//! - The implementer of the pallet's associated
//!   `DecreasedForeignInvestOrderHook` type handles the refund of the decreased
//!   amount to the investor.
//! - The implementer of the pallet's associated
//!   `CollectedForeignRedemptionHook` type handles the transfer of the
//!   collected amount in foreign currency to the investor.
