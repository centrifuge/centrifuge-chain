	/// * If there is no swap into foreign currency, the pool currency swap
	///   amount is increased.
	/// * Else, resolves opposite swap directions by immediately fulfilling the
	///   side with lower amounts; or both if the swap amounts are equal.
	///
	/// When we increase an investment, we normally have to swap it into pool
	/// currency (`ActiveSwapIntoPoolCurrency`) before it can be invested
	/// (`ActiveInvestmentOngoing`). However, if the current state includes
	/// swapping back into pool currency (`ActiveSwapIntoForeignCurrency`) as
	/// the result of a previous decrement, then we can minimize the amount
	/// which needs to be swapped such that we always have **at most a single
	/// active swap** which is the maximum of `pool_swap.amount` and
	/// `foreign_swap.amount`. When we do this, we always need to bump the
	/// investment amount as well as the `SwapIntoForeignDone` amount as a
	/// result of immediately fulfilling the pool swap order up to the possible
	/// amount.
	///
	/// Example:
	/// * Say before my pre invest state has `foreign_done = 1000` and
	/// `foreign_swap.amount = 500`. Now we  look at three scenarios in which we
	/// increase below, exactly at and above the `foreign_swap.amount`:
	/// * a) If we increase by 500, we can reduce the `foreign_swap.amount`
	///   fully, which we denote by adding the 500 to the `foreign_done` amount.
	///   Moreover, we can immediately invest the 500. The resulting state is
	///   `(done_amount = 1500, investing = 500)`.
	/// * b) If we increase by 400, we can reduce the `foreign_swap.amount` only
	///   by 400 and increase both the `investing` as well as `foreign_done`
	///   amount by that. The resulting state is
	/// `(done_amount = 1400, foreign_swap.amount = 100, investing = 400)`.
	/// * c) If we increase by 600, we can reduce the `foreign_swap.amount`
	///   fully and need to add a swap into pool currency for 100. Moreover both
	///   the `investing` as well as `foreign_done` amount can only be increased
	///   by 500. The resulting state is
	/// `(done_amount = 1500, pool_swap.amount = 100, investing = 500)`.
	///
	/// NOTES:
	/// * We can never directly compare `swap.amount` and `invest_amount` with
	///   `foreign_swap.amount` and `done_amount` if the currencies mismatch as
	///   the former pair is denominated in pool currency and the latter one in
	///   foreign currency.
	/// * We can ignore handling all states which include `*SwapIntoForeignDone`
	///   without `ActiveSwapIntoForeignCurrency*` as we consume the done amount
	///   and transition in the post transition phase. To be safe and to not
	///   make any unhandled assumptions, we throw `DispatchError::Other` for
	///   these states though we need to make sure this can never occur!
