//! # Claim module for crowdloan compaign
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This module (or pallet) is used to proces reward claims from Contributors
//! who locked tokens on the Polkadot/Kusama relay chain for participating in
//! a crowdloan campaign.
//!
//! This module is intimately bound to the crowdloan-reward module, where the rewarding
//! strategy (or logic) is implemented.
//! 
//! ## Callable functions
//!
//! Callable functions, also considered as transactions, materialize the module interface
//! (or contract). Here's the callable functions implemented in this module:

// Runtime events
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Events are a simple means of reporting specific conditions and circumstances
// that have happened that users, Dapps and/or chain explorers would find
// interesting and otherwise difficult to detect.
// Events can be used, for instance, to provide the module with life-cycle hooks
// other components can bind to.
//
// See https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/events

// Runtime storage
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This allows for type-safe usage of the Substrate storage database, so you can
// keep things around between blocks.

// Callable (dispatchable) functions (i.e. module contract)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This defines the `Module` struct that is ultimately exported from this pallet.
// It defines the callable functions that this pallet exposes and orchestrates
// actions this pallet takes throughout block execution.
// Dispatchable functions allows users to interact with the pallet and invoke state changes.
// These functions materialize as "extrinsics", which are often compared to transactions.
// Dispatchable functions must be annotated with a weight and must return a DispatchResult.
