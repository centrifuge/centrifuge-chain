Centrifuge Chain is [Centrifuge](https://centrifuge.io)'s [substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) based chain.

## Build

Install Rust:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Initialize your Wasm Build environment:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh install-toolchain
```

Build Wasm and native code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Run

### Tests

```bash
cargo test -p centrifuge-chain-runtime --release
```

### Start local Relay chain(alice and bob) and Parachain(alice)  

Start relay chain
```bash
./scripts/init.sh start-relay-chain
```

Start  centrifuge-chain as parachain
```bash
./scripts/init.sh start-parachain
```

Note: above command will show logs and block until parachain is stopped  
Detailed logs may be shown by running the node with the following environment variables set: `RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1`.

Onboard parachain to Relay chain
```bash
./scripts/init.sh onboard-parachain
```

### Generating a new genesis file

1. Be sure to change the `id` and `protocol_id` in `src/chain_spec.rs`
2. Run `cargo run --release build-spec --disable-default-bootnode --chain fulvous > res/[name]-spec.json` to export the chain spec
3. Commit

## Linting

Lint the project with `cargo +nightly fmt`. This excludes certain paths (defined in `rustfmt.toml`) that we want to stay as close as possible to `paritytech/substrate` to simplify upgrading to new releases.

## Verifying Runtime
1. Check out the commit at which the runtime was built.
2. Run `TARGET=build-runtime RUST_TOOLCHAIN=nightly ./ci/script.sh`
3. A similar output is generated
```
✨ Your Substrate WASM Runtime is ready! ✨

4. `Proposal` hash should match the runtime upgrade proposal

## Upgrading Substrate, Polkadot, and Grandpa bridge gadget
1. Pull the latest commit of `cumulus` that is building without issues.
2. Then take the commits of `substrate, polkadot, and grandap-bridge-gadget` from Cargo.lock of cumulus.
3. Move our substrate fork `master` branch to commit you derived above.
4. Then for each repo in the order `grandpa-bridge-gadget, polkadot, and cumulus`, 
   move our fork's `master` branch to the commit derived above and rebase those on `centrifuge` branch
5. Then on centrifuge, deleting Cargo.lock file and running `cargo check`  will pull the latest commits from respective forks 

## Generate new Spec and Parachain files
This script will take a valid chain-spec chain_id, a parachain_id and a flag to build new spec or not, and will output genesis spec (raw and plain), wasm and state files.
```shell
./scripts/export_parachain_files.sh charcoal-staging 10001 true
```
Adapt parameters accordingly.

## Benchmarking pallets
Pallets are to be benchmarked to find the correct weight for extrinsics. Follow substrate's benchmarking boiler-plate code
and add pallet benchmark to the runtime. Then run the following script to generate a benchamarked `weights.rs` file for the pallet
```shell
./scripts/init.sh benchmark <your_pallet> <output generated weight file>(optional)
```

Example command to generate `pallet_fees` with default `output`
```shell
./scripts/init.sh benchmark pallet_fees
```

default output will be `./pallets/fees/src/weight.rs`
You can override this by passing output path as last argument
