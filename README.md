[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain)

Centrifuge Chain is [Centrifuge](https://centrifuge.io)'s [substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) based chain.

## Build

Install Rust:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Initialize your Wasm Build environment:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh install-toolchain
```

Build Wasm and native code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Run

### Tests

```bash
cargo test -p centrifuge-runtime --release
```

### Start local Relay chain(alice and bob) and Parachain(alice)

Prerequisites:
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [*jd*](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

Start relay chain
```bash
./scripts/init.sh start-relay-chain
```

Start  centrifuge-chain as parachain
```bash
./scripts/init.sh start-parachain
```

Note: the command above will show logs and block until the parachain is stopped
Detailed logs may be shown by running the node with the following environment variables set: `RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1`.

Onboard parachain to Relay chain
```bash
./scripts/init.sh onboard-parachain
```

## Linting

Lint the project with `cargo +nightly fmt`. This excludes certain paths (defined in `rustfmt.toml`) that we want to stay as close as possible to `paritytech/substrate` to simplify upgrading to new releases.

## Verifying Runtime
1. Check out the commit at which the runtime was built.
2. Run `TARGET=build-runtime RUST_TOOLCHAIN=nightly ./ci/script.sh`
3. A similar output is generated

4. `Proposal` hash should match the runtime upgrade proposal

## Generate new Spec and Parachain files
This script will take a valid chain-spec chain_id, a parachain_id and a flag to build new spec or not, and will output genesis spec (raw and plain), wasm and state files.
```shell
./scripts/export_parachain_files.sh charcoal-staging 10001 true
```
Adapt parameters accordingly.


## Benchmarking

### Benchmarking pallets
Pallets are to be benchmarked to find the correct weight for extrinsics. Follow substrate's benchmarking boiler-plate code
and add pallet benchmark to the runtime. Then run the following script to generate a benchamarked `weights.rs` file for the pallet
```shell
./scripts/init.sh benchmark <your_pallet> <output generated weight file>(optional)
```

Example command to generate `pallet_fees` with default `output`
```shell
./scripts/init.sh benchmark pallet_fees
```

default output will be `./pallets/fees/src/weight.rs`
You can override this by passing output path as last argument

### Benchmarking runtimes

When benchmarking pallets, we are just running the benchmarking scenarios they specify
within their mocked runtime. This fails to actually benchmark said pallet in the context
in which it will be actually used in production: within a specific runtime and composing
with other pallets.

To cover that, we run test for every pallet for a given runtime and use the output weights
in production since those are the most trustworthy weights we can use.

Note: This command should be run in a cloud environment that mimics closely the specs of
the collator node the parachain will be running on.

```shell
./scripts/runtime_benchmarks.sh <runtime>
```

# Upgrading to a newer Polkadot / Substrate / Cumulus version

When a new version of Polkadot is released, a mirroring release happens for the other
parity projects such as Substrate and Cumulus, but also for other third-party projects
such as the `orml` pallets, `xcm-simulator`, etc.

You can follow these steps tailored to update only one of those specific projects
updating the three simultaneously is the most common flow.

The flow to upgrade to a newer version of polkadot is usually as follows:

1. Use [`diener`](https://github.com/bkchr/diener) to update Polkadot, Substrate, and Cumulus to said release

```shell
export POLKADOT_NEW_VERSION="<version>"; # for example, 0.9.24

diener update --polkadot --branch release-v$POLKADOT_NEW_VERSION;
diener update --substrate --branch polkadot-v$POLKADOT_NEW_VERSION;
diener update --cumulus --branch polkadot-v$POLKADOT_NEW_VERSION;
```

2. Repeat step 1 for our other repos that we depend on:

- [centrifuge/chainbridge-substrate](https://github.com/centrifuge/chainbridge-substrate)
- [centrifuge/unique-assets](https://github.com/centrifuge/unique-assets)
- [centrifuge/fudge](https://github.com/centrifuge/fudge)

3. Make sure that we point to the latest revision of the projects altered in step 2

Note: If pointing to `branch = "master"`, run `Cargo update`

4. Repeat step 3 for other third-party dependencies that also depend on Polkadot/Substrate/Cumulus

- [`orml` pallets](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library) - All of them
- [xcm-simulator](https://github.com/shaunxw/xcm-simulator)
- potentially more

Note: if any of the project do not yet have a cut for the target polkadot release, either wait or
fork said project and run step 1 for it and open a PR and point that revision.

5. Build and test the project and migrate any introduced change

Tip: if you face compilation errors like "type X doesn't implement trait Y", and the compiler
doesn't suggest you import any particular trait, experience is that there are different versions
of Polkadot|Substrate|Cumulus being pulled; Look at `Cargo.lock` and find which project is still
depending on an older version of any of those projects.
