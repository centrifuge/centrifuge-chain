/// Handles converting a weight scalar to a fee value, based on the scale and granularity of the
/// node's balance type.
///
/// This should typically create a mapping between the following ranges:
///   - [0, frame_system::MaximumBlockWeight]
///   - [Balance::min, Balance::max]
///
/// Yet, it can be used for any other sort of change to weight-fee. Some examples being:
///   - Setting it to `0` will essentially disable the weight fee.
///   - Setting it to `1` will cause the literal `#[weight = x]` values to be charged.
///
/// Sample weight to Fee Calculation for 1 CFG Balance transfer:
/// ```rust
/// 	use node_primitives::Balance;
/// 	let extrinsic_bytes: Balance = 92;
/// 	let weight: Balance = 195000000;
/// 	let weight_coefficient: Balance = 315000;
/// 	let transaction_byte_fee: Balance = 10000000000; // 0.01 Micro CFG

/// 	let extrinsic_base_weight: Balance = 125000000; // 125 * WEIGHT_PER_MICROS
