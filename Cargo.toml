# Cargo patch for PureStake-based crates
#
# PureStake maintains their own forks of Parity's Substrate, Polkadot, and Cumulus,
# and of open-web3-stack's ORML. By depending on crates from the Moonbeam repository, we are indirectly pulling crates
# from these forked reposities, which lead to multiple cargo issues due to duplication versions of crates being found.
# With the rules below, we tell cargo that whenever it finds a crate with source in `moonbeam-foundation/`, that it should use
# the specific official revision of the respective repository at hand.
#

# Apply cargo patch to all the moonbeam-foundation/substrate crates
